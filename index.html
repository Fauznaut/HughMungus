        his life. He wants for nothing but the happiness and safety
        of those around him. He is known for his steel temperament
        in the face of adversity, and is revered for his quick wit.
        Although he may die, as all humans do, he will live on in
        out hearts forever.</p>

        <p id="theMythParagraph">They say when Hugh Mungus was born,
        feminists were triggered for forty days and forty nights.
        At the beginning of this cycle, one must post a dad joke on
        one's door, lest one will suffer the same fate as those
        feminists all those years ago. Many still hold this practice
      to this very day.</p>
